NewsFeed
--------

News Feed widget in Django. The main project is a Django App in the
subdirectory "newsfeed". The base directory is a simple Django Project to
encapsulate this one app. The only thing the app cares about is that you have
the fields FANOUT_REALM and FANOUT_REALM_KEY defined in the settings.py file.
